## Project Overview
This analysis dives into the bike-sharing habits of Cyclistic, a renowned bike-sharing company in Chicago. Using the R programming language, I extracted insights that highlight the distinct behaviors of Cyclistic's annual subscribers versus casual riders. The primary objective is to devise marketing strategies that effectively transition casual riders into committed annual subscribers.

## Business Task
The goal is to discern and comprehend the variations in bike usage patterns between annual members and casual riders. By recognizing these differences, Cyclistic can craft marketing campaigns that resonate with casual riders, encouraging them to upgrade to annual memberships.

## Data Sources
The foundational dataset originates from Cyclistic's bike-sharing archives, offering a comprehensive insight into rides undertaken by both annual members and casual riders. This dataset captures details such as bike model, timing of rides, day of the week, day of the month, month, season, and ride duration.

## Data Cleaning & Manipulation
Data wrangling was performed in R. Critical steps encompassed:
- Removing duplicate records.
- Handling missing values either by imputation or omission.
- Eliminating unnecessary columns from the dataset.
- Converting time-related fields into standardized date-time formats.

## R Programming Analysis
Although SQL was initially contemplated, the size constraints of the dataset led to the choice of R for its efficiency. The entire analysis process in R is detailed in the [Data Cleaning and Analysis](link-to-the-file-here) file. For a brief overview:
- Libraries utilized comprise: `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `hms`, `data.table`.
- Monthly datasets were imported into R and stored in separate data frames.
- A combined yearly view was formed by merging the 12 monthly datasets.
- Key tasks included data combination, new column generation, and various data transformations and aggregations.

## Analysis Summary
When comparing annual members with casual riders, certain patterns emerged:
- **Member Type**: Casual riders account for roughly 43% of total rides, whereas members constitute 57%.
- **Bike Choice**: Classic bikes are universally preferred. However, casual riders have a marked inclination for electric bikes.
- **Time-based Trends**: Casual riders primarily avail the service on weekends and afternoons, suggesting leisurely use. Conversely, members are consistent throughout the week, indicating regular commuting.
- **Ride Duration**: Rides by casual users are generally longer, aligning with leisure or exploration. Members usually opt for shorter, consistent durations, indicative of regular routes or commutes.

## Key Findings
- Casual riders lean towards leisurely rides, especially during weekends and afternoons.
- Members display regular usage, likely for daily commutes.
- While classic bikes are universally popular, casual riders exhibit a preference for electric variants.
- Peak ride traffic is observed in the afternoons, especially around 5 PM.
- Saturdays are the most popular day for rides, especially among casual users.
- July is the busiest month, with summer being the peak season.

## Recommendations
- **Targeted Promotions**: Introduce afternoon and weekend-focused promotions to attract casual riders. Highlight membership benefits, especially for extended leisure rides.
- **Optimize Bike Availability**: Ensure availability of both classic and electric bikes during high-demand periods to enhance user experience.
- **Member Perks**: Promote exclusive member advantages like preferential pricing, express bike access, or member-only paths to tempt casual riders into annual memberships.

## Additional Information
The analysis is grounded in the Google Data Analytics Capstone project, emphasizing Cyclistic, a fictitious bike-sharing entity in Chicago. The project adhered to the six-step process of data analytics: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. Each phase entailed specific guiding questions, key tasks, and deliverables. This meticulous approach was imperative to ensure the integrity, credibility, and reliability of the analysis.
